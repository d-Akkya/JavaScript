console.log("1" + 1)    // 11 ('+' operator performs to operation addition and concatination, so the result varies on types of operand on which this operation will perform snf it's type will string)
console.log(1 + 1)     // 2
console.log("1" - 1)   // 0 (js will automatically converts the string into number if possible, whenever there's use of '-' because it performs only substraction)
console.log("1" * 1)   // 1 (type is number)
console.log("1" / 1)   // 1
